# Shell Programming

- The bash shell is actually an interpreted programming language.
- It has variables, `for` loops, flow control, etc.
- Here, we survey a few of the most useful constructs



## Variables

Stored as strings. In some contexts can be used like numbers.

## Variable substitution and `"` vs `'`


## For loops

loop over the .gz files and zcat | wc.

## Redirect `stdout` from the `done`

## basename

## Fancier variable substitution

### Safer: ${j}

### Variable mangling

The one I always use: `${j/x/}`

## Capture `stdout` and put it on the command line: `$(...)`

## Multiple lines separated by `;` or `&&`

## `&` at the end of a line---rarely used in a SLURM environment

## Grouping multiple commands with `(...)`
