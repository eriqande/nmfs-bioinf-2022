    "text": "Welcome to the website for the National Marine Fisheries Service Linux, Slurm, and Bioinformatics training to be held virtually over three days:\n\nDay 1: Monday, October 17, 2022. 10 AM - 12 PM PDT\nDay 2: Tuesday, October 18, 2022. 10 AM - 12:30 PM PDT\nDay 3: Wednesday, October 19, 2022. 10 AM - 12 PM PDT\n\n\n\nThis course will be using the SEDNA high-performance computing cluster located at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. This cluster (and, hence, this course) is only available to NMFS employees and affiliates. If you are a NMFS employee and you are interested in this course, please see here for information about how to get an account on the cluster.\nThis course is intended for people who have already had some exposure to Unix or Linux. You should be reasonably comfortable navigating around the Unix filesystem using the command line. For a refresher, please read this chapter from my online bioinformatics book.\n\n\n\n\nDay 1:\n\nShell Programming (50 Minutes)\n\nShell variables (setting and extracting values)\nExit status, and chaining commands with &&\nRedirection of stdout and stderr, and pipes\nGrouping commands with (...)\nCapturing output into variables $(...)\nLooping with for; do ...; done\nbash functions\nUnix shell scripts (refresher on making things executable)\nbasename and dirname.\n\nProcessing text files with awk (40 minutes)\nPutting these together with some examples. (20 minutes)\n\nDay 2:\n\nComputing clusters and Slurm -Homework: read from the beginning of the chapter to the end of section 8.2 here\n\nLearning about the cluster and your jobs. sinfo and squeue\nWrite a convenience bash function or two: myjobs and alljobs\nGetting an interactive session on a compute node srun\nEnvironment modules on SEDNA\nSubmitting jobs to the queue sbatch\nJob arrays.\nA useful script for orchestrating job arrays from a spreadsheet\n\n\nDay 3:\n\nAn introduction to Snakemake\n\nWill somewhat follow these slides\nBUT, it will be modified to show use of SEDNA’s environment modules and also to show use of a profile for dispatching jobs to Slurm from Snakemake."
