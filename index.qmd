# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the website for the National Marine Fisheries Service
Linux, Slurm, and Bioinformatics training to be held virtually
over three days:

* Day 1: Monday, October 17, 2022. 10 AM - 12 PM PDT
* Day 2: Tuesday, October 18, 2022. 10 AM - 12:30 PM PDT
* Day 3: Wednesday, October 19, 2022. 10 AM - 12 PM PDT


## Prerequisites

This course will be using the SEDNA high-performance computing
cluster located at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. This cluster
(and, hence, this course)
is only available to NMFS employees and affiliates. If you are a NMFS
employee and you are interested in this course, please see 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nn0T0OWEsQCBoCdaH6DSY69lQSbK3XnPlseyyQuU2Lc/edit#heading=h.qpx57rvxr0sj) for information about how to
get an account on the cluster. 

This course is intended for people who have already had some exposure
to Unix or Linux.  You should be reasonably comfortable navigating around 
the Unix filesystem using the command line.
For a refresher, please read [this chapter from my
online bioinformatics book](https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/essential-unixlinux-terminal-knowledge.html).
