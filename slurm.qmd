# SLURM {#slurm}

- SLURM stands for "Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management"
- It is the "queueing system" used to equitable provide compute resources
on the Sedna HPCC.

## Why do we need SLURM?

- The fundamental problem of cluster computing.
- A cluster does not operate like your laptop.
- Most compute-intensive jobs run most efficiently on a dedicated processor
or processors.


## HPCC Architecture in a Nutshell

- **Nodes**: the closest thing to what you think of as a computer. ("Pizza-boxes" with no displays).
    - Each node is attached via a fast connection to centralized attached storage (A big set of hard drives
      attached via "Infiniband.")
    - Within each node are some numbers of **Cores** or **CPUs**
        - Cores/CPUs  are the actual processing units _within a node_. (Usually 20 to 24)
- Sedna, like almost all other HPCCs has a _login node_
    - The _login node_ is dedicated to allowing people to communicate with HPCC.
    - DO NOT do computationally intensive, or input/output-intensive jobs on the _login node_
    - Not surprisingly, when you login to Sedna you are on the login node.

## Hot tip!

In the default configuration on Sedna, your command prompt at the shell
tells you which node you are logged into:
