# A Brief `awk` Intro

- `awk` is a lighweight, completely awesome, little
  scripting language that is perfect for ripping through
  large text files with a minimal memory footprint.
- We will only scratch the surface of it, here, but
  I hope it encourages `awk` newcomers to explore it more.
- `awk` can make many tasks on the command line simple,
  fast, and fun.
- For a more detailed introduction, you might find
  [this chapter](https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/sed-awk-and-regular-expressions.html) of my Bioinformatics Handbook
  of some use. (And there are many other resources online, as well).
